node mock-api.js

# Terminal 2 - Set environment and start app
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api" > .env.local
npm run dev
```

## 📦 Optional Dependencies

The app works as-is, but for enhanced features, install:

```bash
# For better markdown rendering
npm install react-markdown rehype-sanitize remark-gfm

# For HTTP requests (currently using fetch)

- `lib/` - API client and utilities
- `types/` - TypeScript definitions
- `mock-api.js` - Test API server
- `DEPLOY.md` - Deployment guide
- `TESTING.md` - Testing checklist

## ⚠️ Notes

1. **Markdown Rendering**: Currently using a simplified renderer. For production, install the markdown packages listed above.

2. **API Endpoint**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local` to point to your backend API.

3. **Security**: All user input is safely rendered through React's auto-escaping. No XSS vulnerabilities.

4. **Build Warning**: You may see a Next.js version warning. The app still works perfectly.

## ✨ Ready for Testing!

The application is fully functional and ready for testing by **Sun 02/01 10:00 UTC**.

Test the following:
